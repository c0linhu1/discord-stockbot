## Twitter API

- Free Twitter API has a 15 min cooldown time for each dev account 
- Prone to account restricting bc I am using multiple api keys - cooldown for a week before running again if one devleoper account gets retricted

## FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
- Applying machine learning to analyze sentiment from articles
- Incorporating a sentiment command and a scale for users to see whether or 
not a stock is a buy hold sell based on sentiment score
- Either use api again or web scrape to make a channel for Top Gainers and Losers of the day. Will try to do for the week 
too - could technically try to do it myself but would require too many api calls when fetching stop price info 
- possibly create graphs based on daily info for past week/month for stock - dont want to make intraday chart / minute chart bc would require a lot of api calls again 
- implement forex/crypto commands 
- implement ipo commands or a channel that shows upcoming ipos
- implement a channel for sec fillings 
- implement personal trading strategy - maybe llm - using 9/20 ema, 50 sma
